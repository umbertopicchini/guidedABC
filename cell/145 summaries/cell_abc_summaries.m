% cell_summstats is used for calculating the summary statistics of data
% The summary statistics are the Hamming distances and total cells at the final time period.

% INPUT:
% Y - the binary matrices for cell presence at all observed times after time zero.
% Yinit - the initial binary matrix for cell presence

% OUTPUT:
% summ_stat - the summary statistics for the given data

Y = data.Y;
